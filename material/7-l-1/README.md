# Trial exam lab

For this lab we will spend the time trying to solve the theoretical part of an exam.
The size and scope of the exam set is intended to be similar to the real exam. But note that the exam will also contain a practical part similar to assignment #4.

Since we only have 2x45 minutes for the lab and the exam is supposed to be 4 hours, we do not expect you to be able to answer all questions within the lab.

## Example exam set
